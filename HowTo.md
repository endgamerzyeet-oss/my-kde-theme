First, you need to find your theme file. Duplicate it over to whatever directory you're in. Change the name of your theme and other details if you want using the index.theme folder. Then, add the icons to where they are supposed to be. The folders go in 'places' and the other icons go in 'mimetypes'. 

Then, rename the folder this is all contained in (e.g. from 'Breeze' to 'MINEMINEMINE'), and compress it to a .tar.gz file. Then, go to your DE settings, go to Icons, click install from file, and click my file. VERIFIED ON KDE
